# CLYMATE
This basic program can be used to give information about climate change to people who have no clue about it.
It also has an executable file which can be used to run the application. This isn't for providing in-depth information about climate change.
The topic is:'Design a hack or tool that you would use to educate a family member about climate change' The .exe provided is not a standalone exe.
Please make sure that the .exe file isn't moved to any other directory as it wouldn't work. FOR 'Hack n Code'
